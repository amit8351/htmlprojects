            <h3>We stumbled upon this hidden gem just a short drive away from Ubud’s city centre – a quiet little cafe – a refreshing break from the bustle and heavy traffic of Jalan Raya Ubud.</h3>
            <h3>Over here, you can choose to sit indoors, or outdoors right next to a vast field of paddy fields. It was quite comfortable outdoors and only slightly warm, even though we were there at around 10am (and as fellow Southeast Asians, we’re definitely not a fan of the tropical heat!).</h3>
            <h3>We felt super chill and comfy, not to mention the cafe has a beautiful earth-tone decor – so it’s IG-worthy in almost every corner.</h3>
            <h3>Here, they serve both Western, Mexican fusion and Indonesian breakfasts and snacks (their quesadillas were delicious!). They also have good options for desserts and coffee too! If you’re looking for something healthy, there’s lots of options to choose from – from salads, poke bowls, to smoothies and more.</h3>
            <h3>Their wifi is also pretty strong – so fellow digital nomads, feel free to get some work done after brekkie. After all, isn’t working by the beach or in the middle of rice paddies the dream in Bali?!</h3>
